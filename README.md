- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, how are you

Below are some courses I've taken throughout the years and interesting codework/course notes. They're sorted in order of what I found most interesting (and well documented). Due to poor oversight 5 years ago, some of my earlier work may not be uploaded (CSE63, poor documentation, and STAT E-150, uninterresting and SPSS heavy).


1. CSCI E-25 - Computer Vision (Spring 2022): Ongoing
2. CSCI S-89c - Deep Reinforcement Learning (Summer 2020): TODO
3. CSCI-88 (Fall 2018) - Big Data Processing: https://github.com/acaide/CSCI-E88
4. CS109 (Summer 2018) - Introduction to Data Science: https://github.com/acaide/CS109
5. CS E63 (Fall 2017) - Big Data Analytics: TODO (probably won't)
6. STAT E-150 - Intermediate Statistics: Methods and Modeling: TODO (probably won't)
